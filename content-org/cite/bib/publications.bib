Second, current link layer technologies are completely ICN agnostic, which prevents filtering of ICN packets at the device driver level. Consequently, any ICN packet, Interest as well as data, is processed by the CPU. This sacrifices local system resources and disregards link layer support functions such as wireless retransmission. We argue for a mapping of names to MAC addresses to efficiently handle ICN packets, and start exploring dynamic face-based mapping schemes. We analyze the impact of this link-layer adaptation in real-world experiments and quantitatively compare to different configurations. Our findings on processing, reliability, and energy consumptions on constrained devices indicate significant gains in larger networks.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly evolving based on low-power compliant protocol standards that extend the Internet into the embedded world. Pioneering implementations have proven it is feasible to inter-network very constrained devices, but had to rely on peculiar cross-layered designs and offer a minimalistic set of features. In the long run, however, professional use and massive deployment of IoT devices require full-featured, cleanly composed, and flexible network stacks. This paper introduces the networking architecture that turns RIOT into a powerful IoT system, to enable low-power wireless scenarios. RIOT networking offers (i) a modular architecture with generic interfaces for plugging in drivers, protocols, or entire stacks, (ii) support for multiple heterogeneous interfaces and stacks that can concurrently operate, and (iii) GNRC, its cleanly layered, recursively composed default network stack. We contribute an in-depth analysis of the communication performance and resource efficiency of RIOT, both on a micro-benchmarking level as well as by comparing IoT communication across different platforms. Our findings show that, though it is based on significantly different design trade-offs, the networking subsystem of RIOT achieves a performance equivalent to that of Contiki and TinyOS, the two operating systems which pioneered IoT software platforms.},

  abstract = {Industrial production plants traditionally include sensors for monitoring or documenting processes, and actuators for enabling corrective actions in cases of misconfigurations, failures, or dangerous events. With the advent of the IoT, embedded controllers link these 'things' to local networks that often are of low power wireless kind, and are interconnected via gateways to some cloud from the global Internet. Inter-networked sensors and actuators in the industrial IoT form a critical subsystem while frequently operating under harsh conditions. It is currently under debate how to approach inter-networking of critical industrial components in a safe and secure manner. In this paper, we analyze the potentials of ICN for providing a secure and robust networking solution for constrained controllers in industrial safety systems. We showcase hazardous gas sensing in widespread industrial environments, such as refineries, and compare with IP-based approaches such as CoAP and MQTT. Our findings indicate that the content-centric security model, as well as enhanced DoS resistance are important arguments for deploying Information Centric Networking in a safety-critical industrial IoT. Evaluation of the crypto efforts on the RIOT operating system for content security reveal its feasibility for common deployment scenarios.},

Protocols such as CoAP or MQTT-SN are weakened by the overhead of DTLS sessions, which in common deployment protect content transfer only up to the gateway. To preserve end-to-end content security throughout gateways and proxies, the IETF CoRE working group recently developed OSCORE as an extension to CoAP, which adds content object security features commonly known from Information Centric Networks (ICN). This paper presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect request-response transactions. We measure protocol performances of CoAP over DTLS, OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios. Our findings indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless regimes due to omitting the overhead of maintaining security sessions at endpoints, and (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions.},

Independently, the IETF CoAP protocol group started to develop mechanisms that support autonomous content processing and in-network storage. In this paper, we explore the emerging CoAP protocol building blocks and how they contribute to an information-centric network architecture for a data-oriented RESTful Web of Things. We discuss design options and measure characteristic performances of different network configurations, which deploy CoAP proxies and OSCORE content object security, and compare with NDN\@. Our findings indicate an almost continuous design space ranging from plain CoAP at the one end to NDN on the other. On both ends---ICN and CoAP---we identify protocol features and aspects whose mutual transfer potentially improves design and operation of the other.},

  abstract = {In this short paper, we analyze the benefits of integrating 6LoWPAN Selective Fragment Recovery (SFR) in ICNLoWPAN. We present a solution that allows for immediate fragment forwarding---a key feature of SFR---in combination with ICN caching. For this a \emph{Virtual Reassembling Endpoint} (VREP) is proposed which acts transparently as an SFR fragment forwarder while simultaneously collecting them. Once a datagram is complete, it is exposed to the content cache, effectively making the VREP the new fragmenting endpoint. Our proposal complies with current specs defined in the IETF/IRTF. Furthermore, we offer considerations to combine the reverse path forwarding schemes of both SFR and ICNLoWPAN and assess drawbacks and benefits. In preliminary experiments, we evaluate the network performance of combining ICNLoWPAN with SFR and~VREP.},

Information Centric Networking (ICN) is considered a promising communication technology in this regime, as it increases reliability by ubiquitous caching and eases transmission efforts by hop-wise forwarding. Common ICN layers such as NDN, however, were designed for fixed network infrastructure and require an adaptation layer to the constrained wireless - as the common Internet Protocol does. In this paper, we design and evaluate such an ICN convergence layer for low power lossy links that (1) augments the NDN stateful forwarding plane with a highly efficient name eliding, (2) devises stateless compression schemes for standard NDN use cases with utile data encodings, (3) adapts NDN packets to the small MTU size of IEEE 802.15.4, and (4) generates compatibility with 6LoWPAN so that IPv6 and NDN can coexist on the same LoWPAN links. Our findings indicate that stateful compression can reduce the size of NDN data packets by more than 70 \% in realistic examples, while packet fragmentation operates in a predictable way even for high fragment numbers. Our experiments show that for common use cases ICNLoWPAN saves 33 \% of transmission resources over NDN, and about 20 \% over 6LoWPAN.},

The deployment of IP multicast has proven inefficient, though, due to its lack of layer-2 support by common IoT radio technologies and its synchronous end-to-end transmission, which is highly susceptible to interference. Information-centric networking (ICN) introduced hop-wise multi-party dissemination of cacheable content, which has proven valuable in particular for low-power lossy networking regimes. Even NDN, however, the most prominent ICN protocol, suffers from a lack of deployment. In this paper, we explore how multiparty content distribution in an information-centric Web of Things (WoT) can be built on CoAP. We augment the CoAP proxy by request aggregation and response replication functions, which together with proxy caches enable asynchronous group communication. In a further step, we integrate content object security with OSCORE into the CoAP multicast proxy system, which enables ubiquitous caching of certified authentic content. In our evaluation, we compare NDN with different deployment models of CoAP, including our data-centric approach in realistic testbed experiments. Our findings indicate that multiparty content distribution based on CoAP proxies performs equally well as NDN, while remaining fully compatible with the established IoT protocol world of CoAP on the Internet.},

These demands ever increase with new, agile concepts such as security as code and should be considered a regular operation. Hosting massive firmware roll-outs present a crucial challenge for the constrained wireless environment. In this paper, we explore how information-centric networking can ease reliable firmware updates. We start from the recent standards developed by the IETF SUIT working group and contribute a system that allows for a timely discovery of new firmware versions by using cryptographically protected manifest files. Our design enables a cascading firmware roll-out from a gateway towards leaf nodes in a low-power multi-hop network. While a chunking mechanism prepares firmware images for typically low-sized maximum transmission units (MTUs), an early Denial-of-Service (DoS) detection prevents the distribution of tampered or malformed chunks. In experimental evaluations on a real-world IoT testbed, we demonstrate feasible strategies with adaptive bandwidth consumption and a high resilience to connectivity loss when replicating firmware images into the IoT edge.},

We elaborate this for safety-critical use cases. This paper focuses on the effects of networking protocols for industrial communication services. It analyzes and compares the traditional Message Queuing Telemetry Transport for Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN) with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a current IETF recommendation, and also with emerging Information-centric Networking (ICN) approaches, which are ready for deployment. Our findings indicate a rather diverse picture with a large dependence on deployment: Publish-subscribe protocols are more versatile, whereas ICN protocols are more robust in multi-hop environments. MQTT-SN competitively claims resources on congested links, while CoAP politely coexists on the price of its performance.},

  abstract = {Content objects are confined data elements that carry meaningful information. Massive amounts of content objects are published and exchanged every day on the Internet. The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) augments the network edge with reading sensors and controlling actuators that comprise machine-to-machine communication using small data objects. IoT content objects are often messages that fit into single IPv6 datagram. These IoT messages frequently traverse protocol translators at gateways, which break end-to-end transport and security of Internet protocols. To preserve content security from end to end via gateways and proxies, the IETF recently developed Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), which extends the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) with content object security features commonly known from Information Centric Networking (ICN). This paper revisits the current IoT protocol architectures and presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protect request-response transactions. We discuss features and limitations of the different protocols and analyze emerging functional extensions. We measure the protocol performances of CoAP over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol on a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios. Our findings indicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wireless regimes due to omitting the overhead of maintaining security sessions at endpoints, (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to its intrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions, and (c) OSCORE/CoAP offers room for improvement and optimization in multiple directions.},

To support compatibility with other LoWPAN technologies that may coexist on a wireless medium, the dispatching scheme provided by IPv6 over LoWPAN (6LoWPAN) is extended to include new dispatch types for CCNx and NDN. Additionally, the fragmentation component of the 6LoWPAN dispatching framework is applied to Information-Centric Network (ICN) chunks. In its second part, the document defines stateless and stateful compression schemes to improve efficiency on constrained links. Stateless compression reduces TLV expressions to static header fields for common use cases. Stateful compression schemes elide states local to the LoWPAN and replace names in Data packets by short local identifiers.

This work focuses on the interaction between possibly mobile sensors and actuators in such IoT regimes which deploy the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture. Constrained nodes in interactive scenarios need to be highly responsive but can only manage limited control state. We argue that the request-driven NDN networking paradigm, which prevents pushing of unsolicited data, should be preserved to confine the attack surface, whereas unsolicited link-local signaling can accelerate responses without sacrificing security.	 In this paper, we contribute HoP-and-Pull (HoPP), a robust publish-subscribe scheme for typical IoT scenarios that targets low-power and lossy wireless networks running hundreds of resource constrained devices at intermittent connectivity. Our approach limits in-memory forwarding state to a minimum and naturally supports producer mobility, a temporary partitioning of networks, data aggregation on intermediary hops, and near real-time reactivity. We thoroughly evaluate the protocol by experiments in a realistic, large testbed with varying numbers of constrained devices, each interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4 wireless LoWPANs. We compare HoPP with common ICN pub-sub and mobility schemes as well as with basic MIPv6 and anchor-based multicast mobility. Implementations are built on CCN-lite with RIOT and support experiments using various single- and multi-hop scenarios.},
